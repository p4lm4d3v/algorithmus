# Simple Text Editor

- This is a really simple text editor project made to test my current knowledge and capability with classic [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) site building.

- You can name the file in the first [TextArea](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp)
- Write the content of the file inside the second [TextArea](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp)
- And finnaly you can download the file that you made by pressing the "Download" [Button](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp)
