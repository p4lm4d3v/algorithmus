# Paper Marbling (Displacement)

  - An imlementation of the ["Paper Marbling Algorithm" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_marbling)
  - Heavily inspired by [Daniel Shiffman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) video ["Coding Challenge #183: Paper Marbling Algorithm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7IGZTjC008) on the channel ["The Coding Train"](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) 
  
# Description

  - This is an interactive project with which you can create ["Paint Drops"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Mathematics) that interact displace each other, and you can also create ["Tine Lines"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Mathematics) that displace the drops like a stick would when you run it through the liquid which holds the drop
  - With the keybinds defined below you can do these different actions in the interactive environment 
  - ["Paint Drops"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Mathematics) - _(search for **"drop"**)_
  - ["Tine Line"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Mathematics) - _(search for **"tine line"**)_

# Keybinds

  - Press ```n``` - a drop with random radius will appear where the mouse is 
  - Press ```LMB``` and release on another location - the **start position** (when you pressed the mouse) and the **end position** (when you relased it) will determine a line from which will be create a **tine line** in that direction
