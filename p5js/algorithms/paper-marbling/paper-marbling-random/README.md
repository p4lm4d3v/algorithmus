# Paper Marbling (Random)

  - An implementation of the ["Paper Marbling Algorithm" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_marbling)
  - Heavily inspired by [Daniel Shiffman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) video ["Coding Challenge #183: Paper Marbling Algorithm"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7IGZTjC008) on the channel ["The Coding Train"](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) 
  

# Description

  - This project is a showcase of the ["Paper Marbling Algorithm" ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_marbling)
  - The program automatically, every 15 frames, generates ["Paint Drops"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Mathematics) that interact with each other by displacing them selfs, bc. they are [incompressible](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/incompressible)
  - The program also automatically, every 150 frames, generate a ["Tine Line"](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/Mathematics) 
  - A "Tine Line" is a line that displaces the drops in way that is similar to taking a slim stick and running it through the liquid that the drop is in
